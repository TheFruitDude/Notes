# Notes
This is work in progress. 
To code a Google Keep inspired web-app is the goal.
## I have  a lot of ideas: I want to create some sort of Google Keep notes clone. However, privacy is priority

-visualize the notes as boxes and set color 
-It should delete text inside the text box after you submit

Number one priority should be to implement to save the notes.
Steps to get this done:

Create a json file inside the p5.js web application. 
Every time a new note is created, dump that information to json file.

What's also very important is to implement the option to delete notes. But first we should aim at making it possible to save the notes. 


or later, I could implement a way to draw the rectangle, so that choosing position and color is a smoother experience.
