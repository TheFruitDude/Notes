# Notes
# Just a simple p5 Web Application
## I have  a lot of ideas:

-Treat every note as an object
-visualize the notes as boxes and set color 
-It should delete text inside the text box after you submit

option to save each note. Just dump the contents in json file

Number one priority should be to implement to save the notes.
Steps to get this done:

Create a json file inside the p5.js web application. 


or later, I could implement a way to draw the rectangle, so that choosing position and color is a smoother experience.
